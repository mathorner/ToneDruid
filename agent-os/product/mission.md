# Product Mission

## Pitch
Tone Druid is an autonomous synth‑patch helper that helps Korg Minilogue XD owners turn musical descriptions into precise, explainable parameter settings by providing device‑aware suggestions that learn from feedback.

## Users

### Primary Customers
- Minilogue XD musicians and producers: Create the intended sound quickly without deep synthesis knowledge.
- Sound-design learners: Understand why settings work through concise, educational explanations.

### User Personas
**Bedroom Producer**
- **Role:** Independent electronic musician
- **Context:** Home studio featuring the Korg Minilogue XD; time-boxed sessions
- **Pain Points:** Trial-and-error patching; menu diving; hard to map references to controls
- **Goals:** Get a usable patch in minutes; understand the why.

**Synth Educator**
- **Role:** Instructor or workshop leader
- **Context:** Teaches synthesis concepts with the Minilogue XD in labs/classes
- **Pain Points:** Bridging theory to device-specific parameters; inconsistent student results
- **Goals:** Demonstrate principles with concrete settings; provide repeatable examples and homework

## The Problem

### Intent-to-Controls Gap
Musicians think in descriptors (e.g., “haunting pad”), while synthesizers expose low-level parameters. Mapping intent to controls is slow, inconsistent, and discouraging for beginners.

**Target Impact:** Reduce time to first usable patch by 60% and improve perceived alignment with the requested sound by 30%, measured via built-in feedback and session metrics.

**Our Solution:** Translate natural-language requests into Minilogue XD-valid parameter suggestions with clear rationales, then adapt to user vocabulary and preferences over time.

## Differentiators

### Device-Aware, Explainable, Feedback-Driven
Unlike generic AI assistants, preset browsers, or editor/librarian tools, Tone Druid grounds suggestions in Minilogue XD’s actual controls, ranges, and modulation sources, and explains the reasoning so users learn while they design.
This results in faster creation, better understanding, and reproducible patches traceable back to references.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Natural language → patch settings:** Describe a sound; receive concrete Minilogue XD parameters with reasonable ranges.
- **Device-aware suggestions:** Only valid controls and ranges for the Minilogue XD, including relevant modulation sources.
- **Explainable guidance:** Short, clear rationales linking settings to timbral outcomes.

### Collaboration Features
- **Shareable patch recipes:** Exchange and re-use suggestions so results are consistent across sessions or collaborators.
- **Session history:** Keep traceable experiments and notes that document how sounds evolved.

### Advanced Features
- **Adaptive vocabulary:** Learns descriptors and personal preferences from feedback over time.
- **Evaluation & traceability:** Built-in metrics for parameter accuracy, tool-call success, and perceived sound alignment with reference links.
