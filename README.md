# ToneDruid
Experimentation for an AI agentic coding course. Tone Druid is an AI-powered assistant that suggests synthesizer patch settings based on descriptive or emotional input. It interprets mood, atmosphere, or intent and translates that into practical sound design parameters â€” from filter shapes and modulation depth to oscillator types and effects.
