# Task 1: Canonical Voice Parameter Schema

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #1 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Author the foundational Minilogue XD schema artifact, sourcing authoritative parameter ranges and enums from the owner's manual, and validate the artifact with focused structural tests.

## Implementation Summary
Created a versioned JSON schema covering master controls, oscillators, filter, envelopes, LFO, effects, and program edit parameters, including manual references and modulation source mappings. Added structured metadata describing provenance and consulted manual pages. Introduced focused .NET xUnit tests so the canonical schema can be validated within the primary tech stack, ensuring future consumers detect regressions quickly.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `schemas/minilogue-xd/voice-parameters.json` - Canonical schema artifact with parameter definitions and metadata.
- `tests/SchemaValidation.Tests/SchemaValidation.Tests.csproj` - xUnit test project targeting .NET 9.
- `tests/SchemaValidation.Tests/UnitTest1.cs` - Focused schema validation tests.
- `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/implementation/1-canonical-voice-parameter-schema-implementation.md` - Implementation log for this task.

### Modified Files
- `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/tasks.md` - Marked Task Group 1 checklist items as complete.

### Deleted Files
- `tests/schema/test_voice_parameter_schema.py` - Replaced by .NET-based tests.

## Key Implementation Details

### Schema Metadata & Organization
**Location:** `schemas/minilogue-xd/voice-parameters.json`

Structured the schema with explicit metadata (instrument name, schema version, consulted manual pages) and a global modulation source catalog to aid downstream validation services.

**Rationale:** Downstream services can programmatically confirm schema provenance and available modulation sources before accepting parameter payloads.

### Parameter Coverage
**Location:** `schemas/minilogue-xd/voice-parameters.json`

Captured detailed parameter groups (master, oscillators, mixer, filter, envelopes, LFO, effects, program edit) including ranges, enumerations, contextual notes, and manual page references for traceability.

**Rationale:** Ensures the validation API has exhaustive coverage of user-adjustable voice parameters while providing references for future auditing or expansion.

## Database Changes (if applicable)
_No database changes were required._

## Dependencies (if applicable)
_No new runtime dependencies. `pdfminer.six` was installed locally to parse the manual during development but is not required at runtime._

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `tests/SchemaValidation.Tests/UnitTest1.cs` - Validates metadata, required parameter groups, and enum definitions.

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (structural assertions for schema integrity)
- Integration tests: ❌ None (not in scope for schema artifact)
- Edge cases covered: Ensured enumerations are non-empty and parameter groups include required sections.

### Manual Testing Performed
- Executed `dotnet test tests/SchemaValidation.Tests/SchemaValidation.Tests.csproj` to verify the schema checks pass.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Coding Style
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** JSON artifact uses consistent naming, and the .NET test project follows project conventions with descriptive method names.

### Conventions
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Added schema artifact under a clear `schemas/` directory and documented provenance, aligning with project organization guidelines.

### Validation
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Schema encodes explicit allowlists (e.g., enums and ranges) enabling strict validation and early failure for invalid payloads.

### Backend/API Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Parameter identifiers and groupings are ready for REST resource modeling (structured IDs, versioned metadata) to support future API endpoints.

### Testing Strategy
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Added three focused unit tests only, staying within the 2–4 test guidance for this task group.

## Integration Points (if applicable)
- APIs/Endpoints: _None yet; schema will be consumed by future validation service._
- External Services: _None_
- Internal Dependencies: Motion sequencer, joystick, and CV mappings referenced for consistency with future API logic.

## Known Issues & Limitations
- **Manual Granularity:** Some VPM ratio ranges vary per oscillator type; schema captures common ratios with contextual notes. Future iterations may extend this with per-type constraints.

## Performance Considerations
- Schema is static JSON, optimized for quick in-memory load and validation checks.

## Security Considerations
- No executable code added; artifact is read-only and human-auditable.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Serves as the authoritative input for Task Group 2 (Patch Validation API).

## Notes
- Manual parsing leveraged `pdfminer.six`; consumers of the repository are not required to install it unless regenerating the schema from source documentation.
