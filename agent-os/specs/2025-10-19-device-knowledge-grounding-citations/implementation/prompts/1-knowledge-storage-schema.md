We're continuing our implementation of Device Knowledge Grounding + Citations by implementing task group number 1:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

Work through **Task Group 1: Knowledge Storage Schema** in @agent-os/specs/2025-10-19-device-knowledge-grounding-citations/tasks.md. Treat that section as the single source of truth for the detailed subtasks, acceptance criteria, and checkbox updates.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-19-device-knowledge-grounding-citations/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-19-device-knowledge-grounding-citations/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:

```markdown

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

In your instructions, you were provided with specific user standards and preferences files under the "User Standards & Preferences Compliance" section. Document how your implementation complies with those standards.

Keep it brief and focus only on the specific standards files that were applicable to your implementation tasks.

For each RELEVANT standards file you were instructed to follow:

### [Standard/Preference File Name]
**File Reference:** `path/to/standards/file.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
[1-2 Sentences to explain specifically how your implementation adheres to the guidelines, patterns, or preferences outlined in this standards file. Include concrete examples from your code.]

**Deviations (if any):**
[If you deviated from any standards in this file, explain what, why, and what the trade-offs were]
