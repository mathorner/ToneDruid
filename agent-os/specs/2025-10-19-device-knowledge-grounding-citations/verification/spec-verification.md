## 1. Inputs Reviewed
- `planning/requirements.md`
- `spec.md`
- `tasks.md`
- Visual assets directory (`planning/visuals/`) — none present

## 2. Structural Checks

| Check | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements reflect user Q&A | ✅ | All eight answers captured verbatim; no omissions detected. |
| Visual assets referenced | ✅ | No files in `planning/visuals/`; requirements and spec correctly avoid visual references. |
| Spec & tasks present | ✅ | `spec.md` and `tasks.md` exist with required sections. |

## 3. Alignment Findings

### Requirements vs. Specification
- **User intent:** Maintain simple MVP using only the Minilogue XD manual and Sound-on-Sound Synth Secrets PDF, Azure Blob Storage, and thumbs up/down feedback. **Status:** Reflected accurately in spec (`spec.md§Goal`, `Core Requirements`).
- **Integration expectations:** Requirements now state the feature operates as a standalone console ahead of the Prompt → Parameters flow, aligning with the spec’s reframed goal. ✅
- **Feedback scope:** Requirements explicitly tie feedback to retrieval sessions, matching the spec’s persistence model. ✅

### Specification vs. Tasks
- Tasks mirror the reframed spec: ingestion, retrieval API, console UI, and retrieval-centric feedback. ✅
- Each task group limits tests to 2-6 items and explicitly scopes execution to those tests. ✅
- Task references to `retrieval_requests` logging align with updated technical considerations in requirements. ✅
