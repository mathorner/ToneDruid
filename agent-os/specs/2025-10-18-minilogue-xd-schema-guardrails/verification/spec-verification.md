# Spec Verification: Minilogue XD Schema & Guardrails

## Summary
- Requirements source: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/planning/requirements.md`
- Spec file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/spec.md`
- Tasks file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/tasks.md`
- Visual assets: None found in `planning/visuals/`

## Checks Performed

### 1. Requirements Accuracy
- ✅ All eight Q&A responses are captured verbatim.
- ✅ No missing or altered answers; no follow-ups were required.
- ✅ Reusability section correctly states none identified.
- ✅ Out-of-scope items (global settings, multi-device support, UI layers, etc.) match user input.

### 2. Structural Integrity
- ✅ Spec folder contains `planning`, `planning/visuals`, `spec.md`, `tasks.md`, `implementation`, `verification`.
- ✅ `verification/` existed and now contains this report.

### 3. Visual Assets
- ✅ Command `ls agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/planning/visuals/` returned no files; requirements and spec appropriately omit visual references.

### 4. Requirements vs. Spec Alignment
- ✅ Goal and user stories reflect the need for a canonical schema and validation API only.
- ✅ Functional and non-functional requirements align with recorded requirements (API-only, schema in source control, manual as authority, structured errors).
- ✅ Out-of-scope section reiterates exclusions exactly as stated by the user.
- ✅ No additional features beyond scope were introduced.

### 5. Requirements vs. Tasks Alignment
- ✅ Task Group 1 covers building the schema artifact from the manual (matches requirements).
- ✅ Task Group 2 delivers the validation API endpoint with structured errors (matches requirements).
- ✅ Task Group 3 limits to targeted test consolidation; no UI or out-of-scope work included.
- ✅ No reusability steps referenced, consistent with “none identified.”
- ✅ Each task refers to concrete outputs traceable to the spec.

### 6. Test Writing Limits
- ✅ Task Group 1 specifies 2-4 tests; Task Group 2 specifies 3-6 tests; Task Group 3 adds up to 4 supplemental tests (≤10).
- ✅ Tasks instruct running only the tests written in their group.
- ✅ Combined test expectation stays within the 16–34 test guideline.

### 7. Reusability & Over-Engineering
- ✅ No existing code reuse opportunities were documented by the user; tasks do not invent new ones.
- ✅ Work is scoped to schema artifact + single API; no extra features or telemetry requirements added.
- ✅ No evidence of over-engineering or unnecessary components.

## Issues Found
- None.

## Conclusion
✅ Specification is ready for implementation. All documents align with user requirements, respect testing limits, and avoid scope creep.
