We're continuing our implementation of Minilogue XD Schema & Guardrails by implementing task group number 2:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

### Validation Service

#### Task Group 2: Patch Validation API
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer  
**Dependencies:** Task Group 1

- [ ] 2.0 Implement validator service
  - [ ] 2.1 Write 3-6 focused tests covering: valid patch returns `valid: true`; invalid enum returns specific error; out-of-range numeric triggers error; missing section reports field-specific guidance.
  - [ ] 2.2 Create a schema loading utility (e.g., `SchemaProvider`) to read the artifact and expose lookup helpers with caching.
  - [ ] 2.3 Implement validation logic (`MinilogueXdPatchValidator`) leveraging the schema for type/range/enum checks and assembling structured error responses.
  - [ ] 2.4 Add `POST /api/v1/minilogue-xd/patches/validate` endpoint that invokes the validator and returns `200` with `{ "valid": true }` or `400` with `{ "valid": false, "errors": [...] }`.
  - [ ] 2.5 Document the endpoint contract (input shape, error format, versioning) in API docs or inline README.
  - [ ] 2.6 Run only the tests from 2.1 to confirm endpoint and validator behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Endpoint responds per specification with actionable error payloads.
- Validator blocks invalid patches and allows compliant ones.
- Tests from 2.1 pass consistently.
- API documentation reflects request/response schema and dependency on the canonical artifact.

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:

```markdown

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

In your instructions, you were provided with specific user standards and preferences files under the "User Standards & Preferences Compliance" section. Document how your implementation complies with those standards.

Keep it brief and focus only on the specific standards files that were applicable to your implementation tasks.

### [Standard/Preference File Name]
**File Reference:** `path/to/standards/file.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
[1-2 Sentences to explain specifically how your implementation adheres to the guidelines, patterns, or preferences outlined in this standards file. Include concrete examples from your code.]

**Deviations (if any):**
[If you deviated from any standards in this file, explain what, why, and what the trade-offs were]
