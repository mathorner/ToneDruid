Architectural Diagram: AI Patch Assistant for Minilogue XD

⸻

# Overview

An Azure-hosted AI agent that generates and refines Minilogue XD patch settings based on natural language descriptions, supported by structured synth knowledge (manuals, Synth Secrets). The system provides iterative feedback, telemetry insights, and learning based on user responses.

# Core Components

A. User Interface (Web Front-End)
	•	Description: Text-based web UI where users describe desired sounds (e.g., “sinister bell tone”) and provide feedback.
	•	Technologies: React, TypeScript, .NET backend integration.
	•	Functions:
	•	Text input for patch requests and feedback.
	•	Displays generated parameter sets and explanations.
	•	Sends/receives JSON payloads via API Gateway.

⸻

B. API Gateway / Backend Service Layer
	•	Description: Mediates between the web front-end, Azure OpenAI endpoint, telemetry system, and data storage.
	•	Technologies: C# .NET Core (Web API / Azure Functions).
	•	Functions:
	•	Receives user prompts and forwards structured requests to LLM.
	•	Fetches relevant reference materials (Synth Secrets, XD manual snippets).
	•	Handles user feedback persistence and patch rating storage.
	•	Exposes telemetry endpoints and aggregates performance data.

⸻

C. AI Logic Layer (Azure OpenAI Integration)
	•	Description: Core reasoning layer using Azure OpenAI LLM to interpret natural language and propose Minilogue XD patch parameters.
	•	Models: GPT-4-turbo or GPT-5 (text completion + embeddings search).
	•	Functions:
	•	Interpret user intent and map to synthesis concepts.
	•	Retrieve relevant technical excerpts using embeddings (via Azure Cognitive Search).
	•	Generate parameter JSON objects and explanatory commentary.
	•	Return reasoning metadata for telemetry and explainability (e.g., reference snippets, internal confidence scores).

⸻

D. Knowledge Base (Azure Cognitive Search + Blob Storage)
	•	Description: Structured store for synthesis theory and hardware manuals.
	•	Contents:
	•	Synth Secrets (tokenized and chunked by topic: oscillators, filters, envelopes, etc.).
	•	Minilogue XD Manual (parameter definitions, ranges, examples).
	•	Feedback Repository (JSON entries: user input, model output, feedback, timestamp).
	•	Technologies:
	•	Azure Blob Storage for documents (PDFs, markdown, embeddings).
	•	Azure Cognitive Search for semantic retrieval.

⸻

E. Feedback and Learning Loop
	•	Description: Enables iterative refinement of patch suggestions.
	•	Flow:
	1.	User submits feedback (“too bright,” “not percussive enough”).
	2.	Feedback stored in database.
	3.	LLM fine-tuned contextually (or via few-shot examples) to adjust tone and mapping.
	4.	Future prompts incorporate learned preferences.
	•	Technologies: Cosmos DB or Azure Table Storage.

⸻

F. Telemetry and Reasoning Layer
	•	Description: Tracks system behaviour and provides explainability for each LLM suggestion.
	•	Metrics Captured:
	•	Success/failure rates of patch satisfaction (based on user feedback).
	•	Processing latency and token usage.
	•	Reasoning traces (why the model chose certain parameters or references).
	•	Conversation transcripts (for improvement analysis).
	•	Technologies:
	•	Azure Application Insights for telemetry.
	•	Log Analytics and Power BI for visualisation and reporting.

# Data Flow Summary

	1.	User Input: Web UI → API Gateway.
	2.	Processing: API Gateway → Azure OpenAI LLM.
	3.	Retrieval Augmentation: LLM → Cognitive Search for Synth Secrets & Manual snippets.
	4.	Response Generation: LLM → Suggested parameter JSON + reasoning metadata.
	5.	Display: API Gateway → Web UI.
	6.	Feedback & Metrics: User → API Gateway → Feedback DB + Telemetry store.

# Example Interaction

User: “Make a metallic, haunting pad with motion.”

AI Agent:
	•	Returns JSON patch (oscillator mix, filter cutoff, LFO depth, FX settings).
	•	Adds explanation: “The slow LFO on the cutoff adds motion, while high resonance and shimmer reverb enhance the metallic timbre.”

Telemetry: Logs reasoning summary, confidence rating, and source references.

User Feedback: “Too sharp, reduce resonance.”

System: Logs feedback, updates metrics, adjusts LLM guidance next iteration.
