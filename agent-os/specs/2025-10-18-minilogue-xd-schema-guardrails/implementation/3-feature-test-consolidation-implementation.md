# Task 3: Feature Test Consolidation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/tasks.md`  
**Implemented By:** testing-engineer  
**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Ensure validation coverage from Task Groups 1 and 2 is consolidated by filling high-risk gaps with targeted integration tests and confirming the end-to-end feature suite passes.

## Implementation Summary
Reviewed the schema-loading tests (Task 1.1) and validator HTTP integration tests (Task 2.1) to catalogue existing behaviors: schema bootstrap, happy-path validation, enum rejection, numeric bounds, and missing section handling. From that review, identified missing coverage around malformed payloads, unknown parameters, multi-error aggregation, and list parameter validation.

Added four supplemental API integration tests that exercise those gaps using the existing minimal API test harness. The tests confirm the validator gracefully rejects non-object payloads, flags schema-unknown parameters, returns multiple errors when several violations occur, and enforces the allowed-value set for list parameters. Running the consolidated suite (schema + validator + new tests) verifies all scenarios pass.

## Files Changed/Created

### New Files
- `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/implementation/3-feature-test-consolidation-implementation.md` - Implementation record for Task Group 3.

### Modified Files
- `tests/PatchValidation.Tests/PatchValidationApiTests.cs` - Added four high-priority integration tests covering malformed payloads, unknown parameters, multi-error aggregation, and list entry validation.
- `agent-os/specs/2025-10-18-minilogue-xd-schema-guardrails/tasks.md` - Marked Task Group 3 parent and sub-tasks as complete.

### Deleted Files
- None

## Key Implementation Details

### Supplemental API Tests
**Location:** `tests/PatchValidation.Tests/PatchValidationApiTests.cs`

Added four focused `[Fact]` cases that reuse the existing `WebApplicationFactory` host. Tests verify rejection of non-object payloads, detection of unsupported parameters, simultaneous error reporting when multiple violations are present, and enforcement of allowed list values.

**Rationale:** These scenarios represent the highest-risk validation edges still uncovered after Tasks 1 and 2 and directly protect user-facing error messaging expectations.

### Consolidated Test Execution
**Location:** `tests/SchemaValidation.Tests`, `tests/PatchValidation.Tests`

Executed schema-loading tests alongside the expanded validator suite to confirm the full feature’s regression signal remains green after consolidation.

**Rationale:** Demonstrates that legacy coverage remains intact while the new tests pass, fulfilling Task 3.4’s requirement.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### coding-style.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Followed existing naming conventions and kept new test methods concise with clear intent-revealing names, matching the guideline for consistent, meaningful naming and focused functions.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### commenting.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Relied on self-explanatory test names and structures without introducing superfluous comments, aligning with the preference for minimal, evergreen commentary.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### conventions.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Worked on a feature branch and updated the spec documentation to keep project process artifacts current, supporting the repository’s documentation and version-control conventions.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### error-handling.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** New tests assert that validation failures return clear, actionable messages for malformed payloads and invalid fields, reinforcing the guideline of user-friendly error reporting.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### tech-stack.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/tech-stack.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Leveraged the .NET 9/xUnit stack already defined for integration testing without introducing additional tooling or frameworks.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### validation.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Tests target server-side validation behaviors, ensuring rejected payloads deliver specific field-level feedback consistent with the prescribed validation practices.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

### test-writing.md
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Your Implementation Complies:** Added only four high-value integration tests focused on critical workflows and error handling, avoiding broad edge-case enumeration in line with the strategic testing guidance.

**Deviations (if any):** None.

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/minilogue-xd/patches/validate` - Exercised via integration tests to confirm validation behavior.

### External Services
- None

### Internal Dependencies
- Relies on `MinilogueXdPatchValidator` and `SchemaProvider` for validation logic.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
- None identified.

### Limitations
- Current tests focus on JSON-level validation; payloads with deeply nested alias scenarios remain covered by existing schema resolution logic.

## Performance Considerations
No performance changes introduced; integration tests operate on small payloads with negligible runtime impact.

## Security Considerations
No security-affecting changes; tests verify server-side validation continues to reject malformed input.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
No new dependencies created; Task Groups 1 and 2 remain prerequisites for the consolidated tests.

## Notes
Test runs (2025-10-19):
- `dotnet test tests/SchemaValidation.Tests/SchemaValidation.Tests.csproj` (Passed)
- `dotnet test tests/PatchValidation.Tests/PatchValidation.Tests.csproj` (Passed)
